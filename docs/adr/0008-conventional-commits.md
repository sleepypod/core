# ADR: Conventional Commits

## Context
We chose to adopt the Conventional Commits specification for this project to improve commit message consistency and enable semantic releases.

### 1. Best-Effort Approach
- While not enforced strictly, we encourage developers to follow the Conventional Commits format.
- This ensures that commit messages are meaningful and provide context for changes.

### 2. Semantic Releases
- Conventional Commits enable automated semantic versioning and changelog generation.
- This simplifies the release process and ensures accurate versioning.
