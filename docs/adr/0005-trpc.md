# ADR: tRPC for Type-Safe API Communication

## Context
We chose tRPC as the solution for API communication in this project to ensure type safety and simplify the development process.

### 1. Type Safety
- tRPC provides end-to-end type safety, ensuring that the types defined on the server are automatically reflected on the client.
- This reduces the risk of runtime errors and improves developer productivity.

### 2. Simplified Development
- tRPC eliminates the need for manual API client generation or REST endpoint definitions.
- It integrates seamlessly with TypeScript, making it a natural choice for our stack.

### 3. Alignment with Next.js
- tRPC works well with Next.js, leveraging its API routes for server-side logic.
- This integration simplifies the overall architecture and reduces boilerplate code.
