# ADR: LinguiJS for Internationalization

## Context
We chose LinguiJS as the internationalization (i18n) library for this project to provide a low-effort solution for adding translations.

### 1. Low Lift from Zero
- LinguiJS is easy to set up and integrates well with React.
- It allows us to start with minimal effort and expand as needed.

### 2. Encourages Collaboration
- LinguiJS's workflow encourages collaboration between developers and translators.
- This ensures that translations are accurate and up-to-date.

### 3. Future Scalability
- While simple to start with, LinguiJS provides features that support scaling to larger projects with more complex i18n needs.
