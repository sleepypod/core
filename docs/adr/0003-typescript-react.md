# ADR: TypeScript and React for Full-Stack Development

## Context
We chose TypeScript and React as the core technologies for this project to align with our team's expertise and the project's requirements.

### 1. TypeScript for Strong Typing
- TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors early in the development process.
- It improves code maintainability and readability, especially in larger codebases.
- TypeScript is widely adopted in the JavaScript ecosystem, ensuring long-term support and community resources.

### 2. React for Frontend Development
- React is a popular and well-supported library for building user interfaces.
- Its component-based architecture promotes reusability and modularity.
- React's ecosystem includes a wide range of tools and libraries, making it a versatile choice for modern web development.

### 3. Alignment with Node.js Full-Stack Development
- Our team specializes in Node.js-based full-stack development, making TypeScript and React a natural fit.
- This choice ensures consistency across the stack and leverages our existing expertise.
